bookmarks.html
==============

Remember the bad old days, when all you had to do to back-up your bookmarks was
to take a copy of Netscape's `bookmarks.html` file?

I've generally grown to distrust Cloud(tm)-based bookmarking services, because
they have a bad habit of disappearing.  (I guess Yahoo! realized that
del.icio.us wasn't really profitable, shortly after they gobbled it up.)  Such
services tended to be black-holes anyway: I would add a bookmark, dutifully tag
it, and promptly forget about it.  Rinse-lather-repeat.

So naturally, I've decided to overload yet another Cloud(tm)-based service, in
order to store bookmarks to the ridiculous number of tabs I generally keep
open.  I haven't decided on a format, or a sane way to keep it all organzied.
Let's see how this little experiment goes...
